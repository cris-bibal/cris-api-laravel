Hi Sir Joseph,

Good morning Sir. This is Cris Bibal applicant for PHP Programmer, I am the applicant last thursday Aug.28, 2014.
You gave me a task to create a PHP Rest API that generate JSON Data and can show the list of users(get),add new user(post), 
update user data(put), and delete user(delete) from database using Laravel 4 framework.

I think I'm done for the task that you gave to me, I already upload the source files to Github repository.


Please click or copy this link to download the source files on Github - 

or you may download the source files on my dropbox backup - 

The database can be download to this link - 

Please import the SQL source file to your localhost.


I created and configured this project in Window 7 platform.


To get the list of user - http://localhost/laravel/public/cris-rest-api/get/users

To post new user (with validations and callback function) - http://localhost/laravel/public/cris-rest-api/post/user?username=jhon_dhoe&email=jhondhoe@email.com&password=password&password_confirm=password&last_name=jhon&first_name=dhoe

To update or put user data (with validations) - http://localhost/laravel/public/cris-rest-api/put/user/6?username=cris2&password=test&password_confirm=test2&last_name=bibal2&first_name=cris2

To delete a user - http://localhost/laravel/public/cris-rest-api/delete/user/4

It's a pleasure to be a part of your team.Hope you like my work Sir.

God bless and have a nice day.
